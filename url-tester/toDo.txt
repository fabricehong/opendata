- make very sure that merging data is something consistent !

before data gathering :
 - arrange id dimensions at the befinning of the columns, in a deterministric order
 - detect duplicate dimension between id and asked dimension
 - throw error or duplicate asked dimension

when creating the GaRow :
 - define canBeConsideredAsData():
    - yes : initially asked as a dimension
